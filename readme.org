#+TITLE: Bundle of Experiments

The name comes from the fact that I was going to play with writing a toy
browser. It has since gone in several very different directions.

./modules/DataStructures contains a rewrite of the persistent datastructures
— HAMTs and Hickey's vectors, mostly — from xprl, along with a transducers api
intended for use both with those and julia channels; the end goal being to have
a library to write functional UIs without the downsides of FRP (probably with
its own downsides). This ought to me moved to its own repo.

./src/graphics contains a jumble of high level Vulkan wrappers and
demos/examples to test them out. ./src/graphics/viking.jl &
src/graphics/particles.jl run examples from vulkan-tutorial.com, whereas
src/graphics/mandlebrot.jl runs an example of an interactive demo (using GLFW).

src/browser is < 1% of a working browser. It can fetch HTML and dump it to a
terminal. That's about it.
