##### Run time data structures

abstract type Node end

  print(io, string(s))
end

### Built ins

abstract type BuiltIn <: Node end

"""
Primitive functions expect their arguments to be literal values. They should
normally be wrapped to make sure args are evaluated.
"""
struct PrimitiveFunction <: BuiltIn
  f::Function
end

"""
Primitive macros operate directly on the AST of the program. They also receive
the lexical envronment when invoked.

### Immediate (eval asap) forms

struct Immediate <: Node
  form
end

immediate(f) = Immediate(f)

string(f::Immediate) = "~" * string(f.form)

function walk(inner, outer, f::Immediate)
  outer(Immediate(inner(f.form)))
end

### Pairs.
##
## N.B. These are *not* cons cells. They're just pairs. What would be a cons
## list in lisp is here a pair whose tail is a vector (list).
##
## REVIEW: Maybe `head` and `tail` ought to be rethought in light of the above.

struct Pair <: Node
  head
  tail
end

pair(h, t) = Pair(h, t)

function tailstring(x)
  " . " * string(x)
end

### Application
##
### I.e. things that are to be applied as soon as possible

"""
Represents an application of args to a function-like entity which has not been
performed yet.
"""
struct Application <: Node
  head
  tail
end

function string(x::Application)
  "#Application(" * string(x.head) * ", " * string(x.tail) * ")"
end

  x.head == y.head && x.tail == y.tail
end

const apphash = hash("#Application")

function hash(x::Application)
  xor(apphash, hash(x.head), hash(x.tail))
end

### Mu
##
### The basic syntactic combinator of the language.

struct Mu <: Node
  arg::ds.Symbol
  body
end

string(x::Mu) = "(μ " * string(x.arg) * " " * string(x.body) * ")"

function Base.:(==)(x::Mu, y::Mu)
  x.arg == y.arg && x.body == y.body
end

const muhash = hash("#Mu")

function hash(x::Mu)
  xor(muhash, hash(x.arg), hash(x.body))
end

### Partially applied Mu
##
### This exists because a Mu is ill defined unless its argument is a symbol. A
### partial μ is a binary node whose left tree will (presumably) evaluate to a
### symbol at some point in the future. At that point we can construct a proper
### μ operator. In the meantime, however, we need to treat the two cases as
### fundamentally different.

struct PartialMu <: Node
  arg
  body
end

string(x::PartialMu) = "(μ " * string(x.arg) * " " * string(x.body) * ")"

function Base.:(==)(x::PartialMu, y::PartialMu)
  x.arg == y.arg && x.body == y.body
end

function hash(x::PartialMu)
  xor(muhash, hash(x.arg), hash(x.body))
end

##### Embedded Symbols
##
## If a symbol is written (read) in a context in which is has a meaning, then we
## have a lexical symbol which has a known (fixed) meaning *unless* it has been
## shadowed dynamically.
##
## A symbol which is not defined in the dev time environment is free. Free
## symbols must be bound by a μ before any attempt to evaluate them.
##
## There is no way to programmatically construct a symbol at runtime. That means
## that you can never refer to something that doesn't exist at the time you're
## writing the code. You can exist to a quantity that you don't know yet (and
## indeed might not yet exist) using the μ operator. That's enough, though often
## awkward to use.
##
## What that means concretely is that *any* FreeSymbol *must* be the lefthand
## arg to *at least one* μ. I'm not yet willing to rule out shadowing like Roc.
## It would make it easier to write the compiler, but I'm not willing to let my
## own ease define the language.

struct Symbol <: Node
  name::ds.Symbol
  env::ds.Map
end

string(x::Symbol) = string(x.name)

function Base.:(==)(x::Symbol, y::Symbol)
  x.name == y.name && x.value == y.value
