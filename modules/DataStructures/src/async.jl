##### Julia Channels
#
## N.B.: These are not threadsafe in the sense that if you reduce on a channel
## multiple times concurrently the different reductions will get different
## subsets of the value stream and there's no way to tell who will get what.
#
## That might be okay in your use case, but probably isn't.
#
## Also, when reading from multiple channels it waits for a message from each in
## the order they're listed. Since progress can't be made until we have a
## message from each, this isn't so bad.

# TODO: Some sort of subscription system where everybody who is interested in
# the values on a channel gets all the values.
#
# The problem here though: what if one of the consumers is being sluggish? We
# can't buffer indefinitely, and in the case of input streams we can't apply
# back pressure (stuff is happening whether we're ready or not). One option is
# to require all input streams themselves to have buffer and drop policies and
# let backpressure fallback to those.
#
# But that would let one slow consumer limit its peers, and worse, potentially
# prevent them from seeing events that they wouldn't have dropped.

# So it looks like each subscriber needs a dropping policy.
