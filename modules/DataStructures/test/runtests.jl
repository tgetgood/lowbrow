# FIXME: This should be doable with modules with a standard function. The
# support structure to let the runtime find all of these modules is ugly though.
#
# Requiring modules to be published to import them is a mistake.
#
# The fact that the official docs say to use `include` statements internally is
# saddening. Julia is such a forward thinking language in so many ways, but from
# a dependency management and modularity point of view it has a lot of the
# shitty cruft of C and python.
#
# Of course one of the primary design choices of julia is that every function
# symbol is a global mutable variable. The "can't modify without explicit
# import" property helps but is a bit of a kludge.
