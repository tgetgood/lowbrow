#+TITLE: Janus

* The Name
  In part the name is a nod to Koestler's later work which has, for a very long
  time, shaped the way I look at complexity.

  Partly I just want to open new doors.

  Plus if it takes off, maybe it can be snuck into other projects by repurposing
  the "js" file extension...
* Justification
  People always ask "why write a new language? What's different about it?".

  When people ask me that, I call this an art project. I work on it because I
  can't not work on it. I refuse to reduce it to anyone's criteria. It isn't and
  won't be justified.

  I refuse to say what it *is* because, in the end, I don't know. And focusing
  on that up front is uselessly limiting.

  Instead, let's focus on a set of things that I don't think should be as hard
  as they are in practice, and a set of assumptions that need to be questioned.
* Usage
  This is still very early. There's no editor support, basically no tooling. All
  we have is a some data structures, an interpreter, and a repl. To run the repl:

  #+BEGIN_SRC julia
    # First time project setup
    import Pkg
    Pkg.activate("./") # Assumes you're running the repl from project root.
    Pkg.instantiate()

    # Optional, takes a while but speeds up subsequent runs
    Pkg.precompile()

    # Run a demo
    include("src/janus/core.jl")
  #+END_SRC

  Have fun. Or try to without rlwrap...
* Docs
  For a primer on the language (in progress) See docs/langauge.org.

  For a bit of justification, in spite of the above diatribe, see
  docs/research-aesthetics.org. That doc is a mosaic of years of my own notes.
  It's sprawling, sometimes repetitive, and often (though I've tried to clarify)
  obscure. Enjoy if you can, otherwise ignore it
